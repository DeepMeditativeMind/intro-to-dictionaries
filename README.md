# intro-to-dictionaries
This is a simple intro to dictionaries using the example of polling people for their favorite ice cream flavors.  The 
poll is first implemented using 2 lists, then with a list of lists, and finally with a dictionary (which is the
shortest, most straightforward approach).

To run the ipynb, from the command line run:
`ipython notebook --pylab inline`

A static version of the notebook is available [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/racheltho/intro-to-dictionaries/blob/master/icecream-lists-and-dicts.ipynb).
